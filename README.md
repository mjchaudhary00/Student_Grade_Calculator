## 📌 Project Overview
The **Student Grade Calculator** is a Python-based console application designed to calculate and display a student’s grade based on entered marks.

The project focuses on implementing **decision-making, looping, input validation, error handling, and modular programming** using Python.

This project is developed as part of  
**Week 2 – Making Decisions & Repeating Tasks in Python**, with emphasis on clean logic, robustness, and professional documentation.
